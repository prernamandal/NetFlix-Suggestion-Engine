We have created 3 folders:
1. Data_extraction_Code
2. Dataset_other_than_BoW
3. R files (contains 4 files)

The improvement which we have done with BoW method is contained in a completely separate folder named "BoW.rar".
That folder also has a separate read me file.

*** We have tried classification on both the datasets, association rule mining on Dataset1 and clustering on Dataset2. 
*** The results are in the report.

The BoW folder has the details of the NLP approach.
